# Site Purpose

This site and the associated GitRepo is the property of Paul M. Garrett, a PhD Candidate at the University of Newcastle, Australia. This document was written to aid other students in the Newcastle Cognition Lab (NewCL) with learning the basic tools used in Systems Factorial Technology (SFT). This document will also address basic accumulator models, such as the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) model and Random Walk model, and eventually, will extend to understanding multidimensional solutions for complex problems. 

This document was started in early 2018, however was placed on hiatus due to the time constraints imposed by publishing, completing a timely PhD, and the simultaneous creation of an SFT package for Matlab. The project has since restarted as of October 14 2019.
